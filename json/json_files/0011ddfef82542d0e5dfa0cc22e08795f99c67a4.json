Detection of the specific antibodies, typically IgG, will be very helpful for tracking the infected population after the disease is controlled, but not for the emergent time. Here, we read with great interest the Letter to the Editor of COVID-19 by Xiao et al. 4 We are also interested in the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

In brief, at day 6 after the onset of COVID-19, all patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG. At day 9 after the onset of COVID-19, the mean level of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM increased to cut off value (OD = 0.105), then increased rapidly and peaked at day 18. The SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibody persisted a high level for about 9 days, then rapidly decreased to 0.215 ( \u223c2 \u00d7 cut off value) at day 39 after the onset of COVID-19. At day 9 after the onset of COVID-19, the mean level of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG was still lower than cut off value (OD = 0.105), then rapidly increased within day 9 to 15 and slowly increased during day 15 to 39. Of the 27 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 17 were severe cases. Comparing to the mild cases, the severe cases generally had an earlier SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM response, and higher SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG levels. All 36 healthy volunteers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG.",

It was first found that the time to cut off and peak values of mean level of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM were day 9 and 18 after the onset of COVID-19, respectively, which was consistent with findings with regard to acute SARS-CoV infectious diseases, where the mean SARS-specific IgM titer was 0 at week 1, 1:120 at week 2, 1:320 at week 3, and 1:160 at week 4 (cut off value, 1:10). 5 The SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM persisted a high level in patients with COVID-19 for about 9 days, then rapidly decreased to \u223c2 \u00d7 cut off value at day 39 after the onset of COVID-19. A previous study showed that the SARS-CoV-specific IgM also persisted a high level for about two weeks, then decreased to \u223c2 \u00d7 cut off value within next 6 weeks 5 , which indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM remained measurable for a much shorter period than the SARS-CoV specific IgM. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM may be helpful in the early diagnosis of acute COVID-19.",

Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG may also be helpful in the diagnosis and in epidemiologic surveys of COVID-19. In addition, our study showed the severe cases generally had earlier IgM response and higher IgM and IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 than the mild cases, which indicating that the humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 was stronger in the severe cases than that in the mild cases. Supporting our finding, it was found that SARS-CoV patients with a more severe clinical course had earlier and higher antibody responses. 6 , 7 In conclusion, the profile of specific antibodies to the SARS-COV-2 was similar to the common findings from acute viral infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV and hepatitis A. The profile of anti-SARS-CoV-2 may be conducive to the diagnosis as well as epidemiologic surveys of COVID-19. The presence of high titers of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in the patients with COVID-19 at the convalescent stage also suggests that passive immunization could be developed for the treatment of the severe COVID-19 patients.",
