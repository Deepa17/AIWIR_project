            "text": "Heart arrhythmia is a severe heart problem. Automated heartbeat classification provides a cost-effective screening for heart arrhythmia and allows at-risk patients to receive timely treatments, which is a highly demanded but challenging task. Recent works have brought visible improvements to this area, but to identify the problematic supraventricular ectopic (S -type) heartbeats is still a bottleneck in most existing studies. This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S -type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S -type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types. As an improvement, we also propose a rule-based data augmentation method to solve the training data imbalance problem. The proposed framework is evaluated over three real-world ECG databases. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines in most evaluation metrics.",

It has been a major worldwide health problem for years, accounting for nearly 12% of global deaths every year [13] . Early detection and timely treatment are the keys to survival from arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a pivotal role in arrhythmia diagnosis since it captures heart rate, rhythm, and vital information regarding the electrical heart activities and related conditions. However, the manual interpretation of ECG recordings is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for the long-term ECG recording which is essential to capture the sporadically occurred arrhythmia [17] . Therefore, an automated method to assist clinicians in detecting arrhythmia heartbeats from ECG is highly demanded.",

            "text": "Heartbeat classification on ECG is a core step towards identifying arrhythmia. As reported by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) [2] , heartbeats can be categorized into five super classes: Normal (N ), Supraventricular (S ) ectopic, Ventricular (V ) ectopic, Fusion (F ) and Unknown (Q). In particular, problematic arrhythmias are mostly found in S -type and V -type heartbeats [6] . Figure 1 shows several ECG samples of different heartbeat types. We can see that the V -type heartbeat exhibits a huge morphological difference against other heartbeats, while the normal and the S -type heartbeats are similar in shape. It is less likely to accurately identify S -type heartbeats from normal ones merely based on morphology. In clinical practice, special rhythm information between two heartbeats, known as the RR-interval, is needed to help identify S -type heartbeats because S -type heartbeats are premature and they normally have shorter previous-RR-intervals than normal heartbeats. However, the inter-and intra-patients variations existing in the heart rhythms still impose great challenges to detection tasks. Besides, the sporadic occurrence of S -type heartbeats can also be an issue that tends to bias an automated heartbeat classification method. Examples of different types of heartbeats. Letters indicate the P -waves, R-peaks, QRS -complexes and T -waves, corresponding to their references in the medical literature. Time gap between two successive R peaks is known as RR-interval. Specifically, previous-RR-interval denotes the interval between the current R peak and the previous R peak. In comparison to the normal heartbeat (class N ), the S -type heartbeat has a less obvious P -wave which is due to junctional premature beating. The V -type heartbeat exhibits a deep and capacious S -wave caused by left bundle branch block. Class F is a fusion of paced and normal heartbeats. The unclassifiable beat is denoted as class Q.",

However, pattern-based classification models often experience difficulties in achieving satisfactory performance on abnormal heartbeat detection, especially when S -type arrhythmia heartbeats are involved. Besides, the effectiveness of extracted features, the mutual-influences among features, and the compatibility between the feature distribution and the classifiers [5] are three major factors that lead to a solid upper-bound on model performance.",

In consideration of the sporadic occurrence of S -type heartbeats, which imposes a great challenge to DNN training, many DNN-based studies use synthetic heartbeats for model training and evaluation [1, 8, 9, 15, 16] . However, these efforts suffer from data leakage because, after augmentation, data is not partitioned patient-wise into training and test sets. So that beats from the same patient may appear in both training and test data. The deep learning algorithms may learn patient-specific characteristics during training and gain a nearly-perfect classification performance on test data. Additionally, the overoptimistic results obtained from data leakage have hided a potential limitation of these DNN models in which only the ECG segmented heartbeats are accepted as inputs. The inter-heartbeat rhythm information, like RR-intervals, is not well considered in these models. Without such information, a high misclassification rate is probably obtained on S -type heartbeats. The problem is still open.",

The RR-intervals of a heartbeat and its neighbors are arranged in sequence form, serving as the input to CLSM. In particular, CLSM learns and extracts hidden temporal dependency between heartbeats by processing the input RR-interval sequence in centraltowards directions. Instead of using raw individual RR-intervals, the abstractive, mutual-connected temporal information provides stronger and more stable support for identifying the problematic S -type heartbeats. Besides, as an improvement as well as a necessary driver for activating the CLSM, a rule-based data augmentation method is also proposed to supply high-quality synthetic samples for the under-represented S -type RR-interval sequences. To avoid data leakage, the benchmark dataset is split into training and test sets at patient level following the well-recognized inter-patient division paradigm proposed in [6] .

Information from the two channels are added together before the pooling operation. The entire DDCNN contains 18 convolutional layers, a pooling layer, a concat layer, a dense layer, and a softmax output layer. Specifically, the concat layer is designed to concatenate rhythm information (RR-intervals) to assist heartbeat classification.

Table 3 summarizes the comparative results. The comparison focuses on normal, S -type and V -type heartbeats because, according to the AAMI standard [6] , F -type and Q-type heartbeats are naturally unclassifiable and penalties should not be applied for the misclassification of these heartbeats. The proposed DDCNN + CLSM architecture performs significantly better than the baseline algorithms on the overall accuracy (95.1% vs 78.0%-93.1%), F1 score of normal heartbeats (97.6% vs 87.3%-96.9%), recall rate of S -type heartbeats (83.8% vs 29.5%-76.0%), precision rate of S -type heartbeats (59.4% vs 36.0%-52.3%), and F1 score of S -type heartbeats (69.5% vs 33.4%-56.3%). The performance on Vtype beats is above the average, ranking the 3 rd place of the listed works. It is apparent from Table 3 that most of the listed works struggle in the detection of S -type heartbeats. We re-implement the DNN model [1] and evaluate it following the inter-patient paradigm. The result confirms that, without considerations of heart rhythm, a DNN is less likely to identify S -type heartbeats. Zhang et al. [17] and Mariano et al. [10] achieve close recall rates of S -type heartbeats as our framework, but they sacrifice S -type heartbeats precision rates (36.0% and 41%, respectively) and normal heartbeats recall rates (88.9% and 78.0%, respectively). This implies that both these two works misclassify a large portion of normal heartbeats as S -type heartbeats. In clinical practice, the erroneous misclassification of normal heartbeats as disease heartbeats leads to unnecessary additional tests, unnecessary patient treatments, expensive costs, and risks for patients.",

The result is denoted as DDCNN Only (without Concat). It is clear that, without the proposed CLSM, both standalone DDCNNs can hardly detect S -type heartbeats. The DDCNN with the concat layer performs better on both S -type and V -type heartbeats than the DDCNN without the concat layer. The outcome indicates that RR-intervals help to identify problematic heartbeats, especially for S -type heartbeats, but the assistance of raw RR-intervals is limited because they are likely to be influenced by the intra-and inter-patients variations. Therefore, having a consideration of neighbor heartbeats and performing an abstraction of the temporal dependency from the raw RR-intervals is necessary.",

The results show that both works achieve promising performances, where the proposed framework slightly outperform Mariano's work [10] in majority metrics. The commonly low precision rates of S -type heartbeats are mainly due to the extreme class imbalance of INCART. ",

We train individual CLSMs with the rule-based augmented sequences and the SMOTE augmented sequences, respectively, and evaluate their classification performances using all normal and S -type heartbeats in DS2. Table 5 summarizes the results. Apparently, SMOTE failed to generate valid previous-RR-interval sequences for training the proposed CLSM. The CLSM trained with SOMTE-generated samples couldn't effectively identify S -type heartbeats, with both the recall and precision rates being lower than 30%. The poor result is not surprising because the SMOTE method is designed for featurized data oversampling. Thus, data like previous-RR-interval sequences with internal connections between elements will disable the SMOTE method. By contrast, using the medical rules as a guide, the proposed rule-based data augmentation method can generate high-quality synthetic sequences that reflect the true distribution of the real-world data to support the CLSM.

In particular, the proposed CLSM structure distinguishes our framework from the others. It provides a promising solution for separating S -type heartbeats from normal heartbeats which is one of the most problematic tasks for existing arrhythmia detection methods. While CLSM has provided a novel idea of how to incorporate heart rhythm to help individual heartbeat classification, we have also implemented experiments to investigate how the input neighborhood range, NeRan, influence CLSM's performance. The default value for NeRan is 25. In our experiment, we try different NeRan values from 2 to 35. The results show a growing trend of CLSM performance with NeRan increasing from 2 to 16. CLSM stably maintains in its optimal performance when NeRan is greater than 20. This means an input previous-RR-interval sequence of approximately 35 s is the minimum requirement for CLSM to accurately capture useful information from heart rhythm.",

In step-1, DDCNN incorporates both temporal and frequent patterns to identify V, F and Q-type heartbeats. In step-2, CLSM distinguishes S -type heartbeats from normal ones by taking advantage of the central-towards LSTMs to learn and abstract hidden temporal information of each heartbeat.

In comparison to the normal heartbeat (class N ), the S -type heartbeat has a less obvious P -wave which is due to junctional premature beating.
