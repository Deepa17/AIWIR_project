Documented waterborne disease outbreaks are primarily the result of technological failures or failure to treat the water . Current federal regulations require that all surface waters used for a drinking water supply be treated to reduce the level of pathogens so as to reduce the risk of infection to 1 : 10,000 per year (Regli et al. 1991) . To achieve this goal, water treatment must, at a minimum, reduce infectious viruses by 99.99% and protozoan parasites by 99.9% (Regli et al. 2003) . If Cryptosporidium concentrations exceed a certain level in the source water, additional reductions are required. This degree of treatment is usually achieved by a combination of physical processes (coagulation, sedimentation, and fi ltration) and disinfection (chlorination, ozonation). Filtration is essential for the removal of protozoan parasites due to their resistance to chlorination and ozonation at doses normally used in drinking water treatment (Barbeau et al. 2000; Korich et al. 1990; Rennecker et al. 1999) . A variance from fi ltration is allowed in some cases if the watershed is protected and carefully monitored for protozoan pathogens.",

Sensitive populations include the elderly, the very young, the chronically ill, recipients of immunosuppressive therapies, and pregnant women (Table 1) . Studies show that these subpopulations are more likely to be infected and experience increased morbidity and mortality following exposure to microbial pathogens than the general population (Gerba et al. 1996a; Nwachuku and Gerba 2006) . Total diarrheal deaths in aged populations (>74 yr) are about 50% compared to less than 5% in those between the ages of 5 and 24 (Lew et al. 1991) . Adenovirus infections have proved problematic for immunocompromised populations, in which a 60% and 53% case-fatality rate is prevalent in bone marrow transplant and cancer patients, respectively (Table 2 ). In addition, Cryptosporidium is identifi ed in 2.2% of all diarrhea cases in developed countries compared to a 7% rate in children and 14% (range, of 6%-70%) in acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) patients (Chen et al. 2002) . Glynn and Rhodes (2005) . g US Department of Health and Human Services (2005) . h Five-year total recipients, 2000-2004. Although diarrhea is the major symptom associated with waterborne pathogens, other chronic sequelae are possible (Parkin 2000) . Chronic sequelae are diseases that develop in the days, weeks, or years after initial infection. Chronic sequelae, such as diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disease, and cancer, can have a signifi cant impact on the individual's quality of life and are sometimes related to infectious disease agents. In addition, exposure to some pathogens can lead to adverse effects on the endocrine system (i.e., Giardia lamblia is linked to hypothyroidism and coxsackievirus is linked to orchitis) (Lindsay 1997) .",

For example, efforts to address concerns over protozoan contamination of water and chlorine resistance have led to an increase in the use of ultraviolet light for compliance with water quality standards. An increased reliance on UV light treatment has subsequently raised concern over virus resistance, in particular, adenovirus (Nwachuku et al. 2005; Thurston-Enriquez et al. 2003) . Therefore, changes in current applications must be carefully evaluated. Expansion of our food supply sources to include regions with deteriorated irrigation water quality and poor hygiene has been linked to foodborne outbreaks where water played a role in the transmission of disease. An example of this is the protozoan parasite Cyclospora caryentensis, which was imported into the U.S. on produce from developing countries (Mansfi eld and Gajadhar 2004).",

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that has recently been recognized as the primary cause of duodenal (90%) and gastric ulcers (80%) (CDC 2001) . It is considered a class A carcinogen, meaning that infections can lead to gastric cancer, the second most common cancer worldwide. Although the disease contribution related to the waterborne route of exposure is uncertain, studies have found 10%-60% of individual groundwater wells contaminated with H. pylori (Park et al. 2001 ).",

Because it is not practical to monitor water supplies in real time and at the point-of-use for all groups of pathogens, episodic contamination events are diffi cult to predict or identify. From 1991 to 2002, the majority of outbreaks occurred because of a lack of treatment (primarily groundwater) or a treatment failure (Fig. 5 ). Efforts to control microbial contamination in drinking water are focused at four primary sites: (1) the source water, (2) treatment plant, (3) distribution system, and (4) point-of-use.

In a 2005 report on the nation's infrastructure, the USEPA acknowledged the need for signifi cant investment in installing, upgrading, or replacing infrastructure for delivering and storing drinking water at an estimated 20-yr cost of $208.4 billion (USEPA 2001 (USEPA , 2004 . In the U.S. there is a wide range of distribution pipe age and materials with varying life expectancies. Pipes in the U.S. are replaced at an average rate of once every 200 yr (Grigg 2005) ; however, the life expectancies range from 75 to 120 yr (AWWA 2001; AWWSC 2002) . Approximately 26% of the distribution pipes in the U.S. are in poor condition, and the annual number of documented main breaks has signifi cantly increased from about 250 in 1970 to 2,200 in 1989 2,200 in (AWWSC 2002 . It is estimated that even well-run water distribution systems experience about 25-30 breaks per 100 miles of piping/yr (Deb et al. 1995) . Using a value of 27 main breaks/100 miles/yr, Kirmeyer et al. (1994) estimated 237,000 main breaks/yr in the U.S.; however, variation between utilities is considerable. Haas (1999) reported results from a survey of water systems that showed a range of average main breaks of 488/yr for systems serving more than 500,000 people, to 1.33/yr for systems serving fewer than 500 people. The public health signifi cance of these breaks in the distribution system is not currently known.",

At least 20% of distribution mains are reported to be below the water table, but it is assumed that all systems have some pipe below the water table for some time throughout the year, thus providing an opportunity for intrusion of exterior water under low or negative pressure conditions (LeChevallier et al. 2003b ). In addition, pipes buried in soil are subject to contamination with fecal indicators and pathogens from the surrounding environment (Karim et al. 2003; Kirmeyer et al. 2001) . A survey of water utilities in North America found that 28.8% of cross-connections resulted in bacterial contamination (Lee et al. 2003) . Negative hydraulic pressure can draw pathogens from the surrounding environment into the water supply where residual disinfection effi cacy is uncertain and variable, depending on the magnitude of such events (Gadgil 1998; Trussell 1999) . Little is known about the extensiveness of distribution system inadequacies and whether they are sporadic or continuously occurring (Lee and Schwab 2005) , but outbreaks have been documented following external contamination in the distribution system despite the presence or requirement of residual disinfectant (Craun and Calderon 2001; Levy et al. 1998) .",

More recent modeling studies have evaluated intrusion events at specifi c locations, with consideration to mixing, contact time, and other distribution system variables, before consumption. Under these realistic exposure scenarios, monochloramine disinfectants performed poorly against Giardia and Escherichia coli. Typical concentrations of chlorine residual (0.5 mg/L) inactivated E. coli in simulated sewage intrusion events but were again ineffective for Giardia (Baribeau et al. 2005; Propato and Uber 2004) .

All participants were immunocompetent individuals who kept health diaries throughout the study to record symptoms related to gastrointestinal illnesses. The source (surface) waters were reported to have varying levels of microbial contamination. Payment et al. (1991) were fi rst to conduct a household intervention trial addressing (gastrointestinal) illness attributable to drinking tap water. The tap water met both Canadian and U.S. regulations, but the source water was subject to contamination from sewage. The limitation of this study is that it was not blinded, so those persons drinking tap water (therefore no treatment device) may have been more inclined to report poorer health symptoms. An overall conclusion from this study is that an estimated 35% of the gastrointestinal illnesses occurring within the tap water group may be attributable to their drinking water. Payment et al. (1997) conducted a follow-up study to address the results from their previous study (Payment et al. 1991) . A goal of this investigation was to evaluate the role of distribution system water quality in gastrointestinal incidence, which resulted in a study design involving four groups of participants: a tap water group and a bottled purifi ed water group (to address those exposed and unexposed, respectively), and a plant bottled water group and a tap water group using a purge valve (to address distribution system water quality). The attributable risk percent ranged from 3% for the bottled plant water group (rate of illness for this group is the same as for those drinking the bottled purifi ed water), to 12% for the tap water group, to 17% for those in the tap water group with a purge valve. The investigators concluded that the excess number of gastrointestinal illnesses observed in the fi rst study may not have been associated with surface water contamination but rather was associated with contamination within the distribution system because the rate of illness of the bottled plant water group was similar to those drinking bottled purifi ed water. A limitation, however, is that about half the participants in the bottled plant water group dropped out during the course of the study. In addition, as with their previous study (Payment et al. 1991) , this study was also unblinded. Hellard et al. (2001) designed the fi rst blinded household intervention study, which was conducted in Australia. Some participants used a water treatment device that involved an ultraviolet application and fi ltration while others were given a fake (no treatment) device. As with the Payment et al. studies (1991 Payment et al. studies ( , 1997 , participants recorded gastrointestinal illness symptoms in diaries, although this study used a slightly more strict defi nition of gastrointestinal illness. Participants were followed for more than 1 yr, another strength of the study besides the blinding of participants, and the investigators observed similar rates of illness of the participants using the fake device as those using the water treatment device. Colford et al. (2002 Colford et al. ( , 2005 conducted two household intervention trials in the U.S. Their fi rst study was designed as a pilot to obtain information regarding the practicality of a study design to include blinding of participants. The investigators utilized a blinding index (James et al. 1996) , which led to the conclusion that the study they designed could incorporate effective participant blinding. The investigators observed an attributable risk of 0.85 and concluded that 24% of the gastrointestinal illnesses could be attributable to tap water.",

Again, the investigators used a blinding approach, and participants recorded gastrointestinal health symptoms in diaries. The investigators observed no difference in the rate of illness between those participants using the fake device and those using the treatment device. The authors offered the explanation that perhaps their study owed this conclusion to successful water treatment practices and a well-maintained water distribution system. In addition, it was recognized that water consumption by the participants outside the home may have had some effect on the study results. Colford et al.

Their proposed approach considers the following: (a) the estimated incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness in the U.S. of 0.65 episodes per person-year based on data collected from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) (Hawkins et al. 2002; Jones et al., 2007) ; (b) the attributable risks determined from the household intervention trials (median attributable risk of 0.08 and a median attributable risk percent of 12%); (c) the proportion of risks of acute gastrointestinal illness associated with source water and/or water treatment quality; (d) the number of people in the U.S. served by community water systems and consuming drinking water from surface water sources and groundwater sources; and (e) the number of people in the U.S. served by community water systems that are known to have either poor quality source water or poor water treatment.",

In addition, the authors created scenarios assuming different risk levels associated with either poor source water quality/poor water treatment or problems with quality within a distribution system.

            "text": "Besides household intervention trials, community intervention studies have also been conducted to address waterborne gastrointestinal disease risks (Calderon 2001; Frost et al. 2006; Goh et al. 2005; Hellard et al. 2002; Kunde et al. 2006; McConnell et al. 2001) . These types of studies offer some advantages over household intervention trials including that they may be simpler and less costly to conduct : they have included cohort, case-control, and ecological types of designs. Two of these (Calderon 2001; Goh et al. 2005) concluded that a reduction in gastrointestinal illnesses was observed as a result of additional water treatment. A preliminary report from the Kunde et al. (2006) study also indicates a decrease in diarrheal illness risk in participants over age 35 following the intervention. Conversely, preliminary data analysis from the Frost study (2006) does not indicate a signifi cant difference; however, analysis is reported to be ongoing for both of these aforementioned studies (reviewed in Calderon and Craun 2006) . Messner et al. (2006) described an approach for estimating the incidence of gastrointestinal disease in the U.S. from drinking water. These investigators assume that for each population served by a community water system, a distribution of incidence rates of acute gastroenteritis can be estimated that can then be used to derive an overall national estimate of this disease attributable to drinking water in the U.S. They emphasize the need for addressing \"mixtures\" of pathogens as opposed to considering health risks from exposure to an individual pathogen as one of the premises for the approach described in this paper. The authors speculate that the mean incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness attributable to drinking water among community water systems ranges widely because of variations in source water quality, water treatment effi ciencies, water quality within a distribution system, and water quality management practices. Messner et al. (2006) propose the development of a \"risk matrix\" to categorize community water systems (CWS) based on relative microbial risk levels. The authors suggest connecting the information obtained from epidemiological studies regarding the incidence rate of acute gastrointestinal illness to risk factors identifi ed in the epidemiological studies that have been conducted and to other CWS. Identifi cation of these risk factors will allow for risk-based categorizing of other CWS that have similar characteristics, therefore assuming that generalizations can be made regarding all U.S. CWS and the populations they serve. Completing this process involves overcoming several challenges from the lack of data related to both pathogen occurrence and variation in survivability and infectivity, as well as knowing the actual effi ciency of water treatment applications, as opposed to theoretical information. Messner et al. (2006) utilize in their approach specifi c information obtained during the Payment et al. studies (1991 Payment et al. studies ( , 1997 regarding factors associated with source water/water treatment quality and factors related to distribution system defi ciencies, and also therefore utilize the specifi c defi nition of gastrointestinal illness as defi ned in these studies, for highly credible gastrointestinal illness.",

            "text": "Based on the described assumptions, Messner et al. (2006) estimate that the mean national estimate of gastrointestinal illness, using the Payment et al. (1991 Payment et al. ( , 1997 defi nition of highly credible gastrointestinal illness, attributable to drinking water is 0.11 cases/person/yr (with a 95% credible bound of 0.03-0.22) ( Table 9 ). The investigators relate their 0.11 cases/person/yr estimate to the reported rate of diarrheal \"episodes\" of 1.3/person/yr (Imhoff et al. 2004 ) and estimate that the percentage of \"episodes\" attributable to drinking water is 8.5%. If this same percentage is assumed and applied to the Imhoff et al. (2004) reported incidence, due to all causes, for acute gastrointestinal illness of 0.72 cases/person/yr, the investigators estimate that the incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness attributable to drinking water is 0.06 cases/person/yr (95% credible interval of 0.02-0.12). When applying the 0.72 cases of acute gastrointestinal illness/person/yr Payment et al. (1991 Payment et al. ( , 1997 studies. Source: Modifi ed from Messner et al. (2006) . from all causes reported in Imhoff et al. (2004) to the 272.5 million people served by CWS (based on data in USEPA 2006b), this results in an estimate of approximately 196 million cases/yr of total acute gastrointestinal illness. Assuming, based on estimates provided above, that 8.5% of the cases are attributable to drinking water, this translates into approximately 16 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness/yr, which is a little higher than the upper end estimate computed by Colford et al. (2006) (11.69 million cases/yr).",

Pointof-use (POU) water treatment devices may be installed at the end of the faucet, plumbed in-line, or stand-alone pitchers, or they may be point-ofentry (POE) systems installed where water from the distribution system enters the premise plumbing. Many POU/POE systems are designed for aesthetic (i.e., taste, odor, hardness) improvements only, while others employ technologies to remove organic and inorganic chemicals, pathogens, bacteria, and radionuclides. According to a survey by the Water Quality Association (2001), 41% of homes in the U.S. report having a water treatment device in place at the point-of-use or the point-of-entry and 39% drink bottled water (Fig. 11 ). Most report the use of a tabletop pitcher, which are currently not designed or marketed for eliminating microbial pathogens from drinking water. Generally, systems designed to eliminate a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological contaminants are costly and require routine professional maintenance. Membranes used for fi ltration in POU/ POE devices must be changed at regular intervals, and systems with ultraviolet light disinfection must be routinely inspected for buildup on the lamps that could prevent effective light emission. Improper maintenance of , -2001 , (WQA 2001 POU/POE treatment systems could result in exposure to a greater concentration of pathogens. In addition, heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria often increase by several orders of magnitude in POU/POE water treatment devices.",

Signifi cance of Regrowth in POU/POE Water Treatment Devices Several factors are related to bacterial regrowth in water, including, fi ltration, temperature, disinfectant type and residual, assimilable organic carbon level, corrosion control, and distribution pipe material. HPC bacteria are able to persist and grow in and on point-of-use/entry treatment device media, membranes, fi lters, and other surfaces to concentrations 10 fold or more higher in effl uent waters. Granulated activated carbon (GAC) is a common medium used in POU/POE treatment devices known to support growth of HPC bacteria. Among other contaminants, GAC removes chlorine disinfectant residuals from tap water. Although this is desirable to improve the taste and odor of drinking water, the lack of disinfectant residual and the collection of bacterial growth substrates provides a suitable environment for HPC bacteria to attach to the media and grow, especially following periods of non-use and stagnation. HPC bacteria may also grow in water storage vessels, distribution pipes, pressure tanks, and hot water heaters. Although many studies have documented the presence of large numbers of HPC bacteria in POU-treated water, there has been no correlation to increased disease Calderon 1991; Colford et al. 2002; Edberg and Allen 2004; WHO/NSF 2003; Payment et al. 1991 Payment et al. , 1997 . Relative to HPC levels in common foods, water plays a minor role as a source of ingested bacteria (Stine et al. 2005) . Certain HPC bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Aeromonas, are opportunistic pathogens, meaning they are capable of causing disease in an immunocompromised host. Although these organisms can be isolated from treated water systems (Chiadez and Gerba 2004), ingestion is not their route of disease transmission. There is insuffi cient evidence linking these opportunistic pathogens to disease transmission via drinking water .",

Pathogens not only decreased at a more rapid rate but were prevented from initial attachment compared to sterile GAC fi lters.

Other populations, including those experiencing \"normal\" life stages such as pregnancy, or those very young or very old, might also benefi t from the utilization of additional water treatment options beyond the current multibarrier approach of municipal water treatment.",
