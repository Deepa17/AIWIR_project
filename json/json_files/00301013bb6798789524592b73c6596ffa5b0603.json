As noted in the guidance, \"changes in a protocol are typically not implemented before review and approval by the IRB/IEC and in some cases, by FDA\" [10] . However, these are not typical times, hence the release of this guidance.",

With regard to the second point, missing information may be related to modified study visit schedules, missed visits, or participant discontinuations. Documentation of specific information explaining the basis for missing data should be summarized in the trial's Clinical Study Report as it will be helpful to the FDA.",

With respect to efficacy assessments, FDA's recommendation is for sponsors to consult with the appropriate review division regarding protocol modifications for the collection of efficacy endpoints, such as employment of virtual assessments, delays in assessments, and alternate collection methods for research-specific specimens, if feasible. Additionally, if protocol changes will cause amended data management and/or statistical analysis plans, sponsors should similarly consult with the appropriate review division.",
