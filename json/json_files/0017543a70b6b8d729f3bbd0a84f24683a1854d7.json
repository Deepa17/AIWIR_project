Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019. 1 The impact on every level of society has been profound and, over the coming weeks and months, the challenges faced by healthcare services will be compounded by the increased risk of infection among healthcare workers and ensuing staff absences due to illness or the need to self-isolate 3 . In the face of public health emergencies, domestic and foreign clinical pharmacists collaborated together to take advantage of their pharmacology and therapeutics expertise to actively participate in the medical activities of COVID-19, and to maximize pharmacists' value and responsibility. 30 In many communities, pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare providers and the first touch point of patient engagement with the healthcare system. 2 In rural and underserved communities and in areas experiencing physician shortages, pharmacists may be the only healthcare provider that is immediately accessible to patients. Pharmacists practicing in hospitals, clinics, physician offices, and community settings are trained to treat infectious diseases and can significantly expand access to care, if barriers are removed. During the current pandemic, it is recognised that community pharmacies will often be the first point of contact with the health system for individuals with COVID-19 related health concerns or who require reliable information and advice 5 .",

Unless prompt action is taken, this sudden increase in demand could have a considerable and detrimental effect on the medication supply chain. Medication shortages occur when the total supply of a medication is insufficient to meet current or projected demands at the patient-level. The reported frequency of medication shortages worldwide has been increasing in recent years and has been described as a healthcare crisis in itself 12, 13 . Problems with local ordering, local or national distribution, or manufacturing can all result in supply problems that can lead to regional or national shortages. The medication distribution system in Nigeria is in a state of chaos and consists of open drug markets, and the activities of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PMV), community pharmacies, private and public hospitals, importer, distributors and wholesalers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers 14 . There is growing concern because although reserves exist, China experienced a drop-off in drug production during the height of its COVID-19 outbreak, though that is leveling off. 16 And India, another big supplier, has also said that it will keep some of the medications it makes on reserve. 17 In one case, a drug wholesaler said that demand for over-the-counter and prescription drugs was 30 to 40% higher than the company's forecasts, which had already been adjusted to account for COVID-19. The problem has been confirmed by a number of pharmacists. 15 Pharmacies can share the information of drug availabilities and its store locations online or through mobile APPs to guide patients when they need to buy medications. For patients not able to visit the pharmacy, mail order or home delivery service can be offered by working with social works, volunteers, care coordinators, or drug companies.",

Back in the U.S., lupus patients have reported shortages of the drug hydroxychloroquine -which is used to treat both malaria and lupus. 27 It is pertinent for pharmacist to dispense the right information to patients amidst this public health crisis so as to ease the panic.",

The shift pharmacists have made in high-income Countries from product-centered to patient-centered services with public health implications took decades to achieve. The shift for pharmacists in low to middle-income countries will also take time.
